// Rust memory model is unlike other paradigms:
// No manual management and no garbage collector.
// Memory is managed through a sysytem of ownership which is checked compile time
// by the compiler.

// In Rust, it matters if data is stored in heap or stack.

// RULES
//  - Each value in Rust has a variable thatâ€™s called its owner.
//  - There can only be one owner at a time.
//  - When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.
